# encodings / embeddings for faces 
    - for this project this is a 128d numpy array which more or less is used to identify a face 
    - this is 128 floating point number from the fingerprint of the face 
# how to generate this encodings ? 
    - before the feature extraction the face is detected and aligned (normalized)
    - this is then resized into 150x150 pixels (i am assuming this)
    - this data is then fed to a neural network that generates a numpy array for the encodings 
# how to find similarities among faces ? 
    - since is this machine learning when plotted similar faces for this 128d arrays can be plotted 
    - and same faces have similar encoding so for finding similar faces we just need to find the encoding which is closest to said face 
    - this encoding are generated by a model so this not human interpretable but for broadview it captures texture,bone structure,eye-nose-mouth ratio etc
